You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

```r
hello.world <= function() {
  print("hello, world!")
}
#=> prints 'hello, world!' to STDOUT.
```


here is some MathJax: $RSS = \sum\_{i=1}^n (y-\hat{y})^2$, hey? Try some more? $\theta^{(5-\ell)} \lambda\_{ij} \eta^2$, right?
